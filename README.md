# mlops_group54
Project repository for MLOps 2026 for group 54.

The goal of this project is to build a machine learning system that can classify brain MRI images into different tumor categories, including a class for “no tumor”.
The project is not only about training a model with high accuracy. The main focus is on building a reliable and reproducible workflow, where every step of the process is clearly defined and can be repeated in the same way. This means that the entire pipeline from raw data to a trained model should be easy to understand, run, and reproduce.
